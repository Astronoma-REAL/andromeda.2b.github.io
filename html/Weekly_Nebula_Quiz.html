So far, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way, with more planets being found all the time.<br> Most of the hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy are thought to have planets of their own, and the Milky Way is but one of perhaps 100 billion galaxies in the universe.<br><br> While our planet is in some ways a mere speck in the vast cosmos, we have a lot of company out there. It seems that we live in a universe packed with planets — a web of countless stars accompanied by families of objects, perhaps some with life of their own.</i></h3> <h2>Now we should test ourselves! <h2> <a href = "https://www.dkfindout.com/us/quiz/space/take-solar-system-quiz/"> Link for the Solar System Quiz</a> <br> <br> <b>
